 - Parker/ Meggit has released a mandatory VSB concerning the rotary buckle of the restraint system implemented on SA/LR (TAAI3) , XWB (TAAI8), DD (TAAI4) seats family. And AD with FAA in under preparation 
 - Thompson Aero Seating informed the operator Service Information Letters (VSIL) that a number of business and first class area seats had potentially been installed with incorrect rear track fittings, due to a quality escape and they request to perform the inspection without Airbus in the loop. 
  
 An other case has been discussed on FMS with Honeywell during the CASID (Continued Airworthiness and Safety Interface Agreement) WorkShop.

 An MSA for allowing Rugosimeter to measure scratches started in February 2022. 
 In April 2023 the MSA was finally declared negative. The use of the Rugosimeter for measuring scratches is not allowed since, due to the inconsistency and the non reliability of the measurements
