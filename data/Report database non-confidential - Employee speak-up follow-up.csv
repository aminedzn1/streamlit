Generally, our repair designs on the SA Flap Track Fairings are wet layup repair (either dry carbon fabric or dry glass fabric with laminating resin). 

However, on A318 with PW6000 engines (A318-121 and A318-122), the maximum surface temperature on the Flap Track Fairings #2 can go upto 104 degC based on the flight test. This is greater than the curing temperature of those wet lay up repair material. Hence, it is detrimental to the wet layup repair material and its strength. Therefore, the interchangeability of the Flap Track Fairings #2 which had been repaired with those wet layup repair materials must be restricted to exclude the installation on A318-121 and A318-122.

There are ~140 RDAF/RDAS which have been issued without the interchangeability restriction. Hence, there is a risk that these repaired Flap Track Fairings #2 would be swapped and installed on A318-121 or A318-122.

- As per TOAC, SATAIR parts were supposed to be secured (scrapped, put in quarantine). However, one customer informed us that several PN which were supposed to be handled by SATAIR were, in fact, installed on their A/Cs.
