 - A-Check Escalation Letter delivered to some CJ Customers (FOC to CAMP Customers) to optimized some A-Check tasks from 4MO to 6MO. 
 - MPD task 341300-11-1 (previously listed in the Letter) had its interval reduced to 4MO back in 2017. 
 - No communication made internally about this change (no link between the MPD task interval update and the A-Check Escalation Letter). 
 - New Escalation Letters do not include this task but previous Letters delivered to Customers have not been revised. 
 - No communication towards Customers who already received the Letter (before 2017). 
 - The Letter does not include any disclaimer that would require Customer to reassess the MPD task applicability/interval according to the successive MPD revisions.

 There were several DICAs issued in SIAEC Shop visits during its core module workscope, out of which DICA 2020/00585/B issued had onwing action to perform inspection on the LPT Stage 1 shrouds at 3200 FC. After shop visit completion, the deviations were captured in the SIAEC engine shop Visit documents. The second shop visit was held soon after SIAEC for other workscopes, and the shop visit documents did not contain any references to SIAEC deviations or open items and had listed the deviations issued only in the Brussels shop visit. 
  
 Currently, Engine 598409 has been removed and sent to shop Visit , and it has accrued 3590 FC since the last shop visit without the performance of the inspection on the LPT shroud as per the DICA 2020/0058/B issued by SIAEC. The engine has overflown 390 FC from the DICA limitations when installed on VTTNB

 And OCC investigation: 
 ""Due to some room for interpretation of the definition dossier the working instruction and the related GTI are missing a full assembly procedure of this connection; e.g. it is not explicitly mentioned that these two wires need to be connected to each other. 
 This lack of information will be closed by introduction of an additional test instruction (Door installation drawing for definition, GTR to trigger GTI update)."" 
  
 At a much later stage in the Final Assembly Line (FAL) the system is completed with the slide and the pressure bottle. 
 As per definition of type ST08 the release cable is neither tested nor touched anymore in FAL. This is a deviation to former types of the A320 family (Over Wing Hatch) where the adapter installation was part of ATA2560 in FAL. 
  
 A quality survey (QSR) was launched to investigate that systematic errors can be excluded. Currently about 2/3 of the applicable MSN have been checked in the FALs. 
 Two certain findings are yet reported which renders the topic beeing not an isolated case any more. 
 MSN 10616 in HAM: Wire lockings were missing (LH and RH sid), connections were given. 
 MSN 10711 without connection on both sides (see Corrective Actions block for details).""

 12 Septembre: 
 Découverte de traces de brûlures sur l'amortisseur du NLG au retour de vol. 
 La décision MAP a été prise de changer le NLG. 
 Jacking et changement de NLG sur le reste de la semaine. 
  
 18 Septembre: 
 SLS vient faire le oil servicing (Servicing N°1), puis gonflage à l'azote par l'équipe DAS. 
  
 19 Septembre: 
 Finalisation Tlb et re-tests 
  
 20 Septembre: 
 L'A/C effectue un vol avec un retour prévu vers 13h00 environ. Ce vol est prévu avec un plan de chargement qui donne un centrage léger arrière. 
 Retour de vol => Operational post flight effectuée. 
  Il n'est pas demandé d'effectuer de prise de mesure du NLG sur la visite et le qualiticien qui à contrôlé le NLG n'a rien remarqué à ce moment, bien qu'il ait apporté une attention particulière sur le fut pour voir si aucune trace de brûlure n'avait apparu. 
 Application du plan de chargement 41 (Lourd avant!) 
 On constate que le NLG vient en butée. 
 On contrôle H,P,T et on demande un avis MAP: 
 Sur demande de la MAP ATA 32: 
 - On décharge le plan de chargement 41 
 - On defuelle l'avion 
 - On contrôle H,T,P avec H52mm pour 145mm, P66b et T:19.5°C => On est pas bon. 
 - On regonfle le NLG et on re-contrôle H,T,P avec H:143mm pour 140mm, P:70b et T:19.5°C => On est bon. 
 - On recharge le plan de chargement 41 et on refait le fuelling. 
 - On refait un check H,T,P du NLG après la mise en conf A/C et on s'aperçoit que la hauteur/pression rechute. 
 On redemande un avis MAP 
 A la demande de la MAP: 
 - On jacke l'A/C 
 - On mesure H,T,P avion jacké. (Pression basse mais hauteur correcte amortisseur détendu) 
 - On refait le servicing huile par SLS suivant AMM (il manquait 0.8l) avec présence de la MAP (Servicing N°2). 
 - Remplacement de la nato par l'équipe SLS. 
  
 22 Septembre: 
 Gonflage à l'azote du NLG suivant AMM par l'équipe DAS en présence de la MAP (Je tiens à préciser qu'il existe un outillage de gonflage qui vient se positionner sur la nato et qui n'est pas disponible au FT!) 
 Puis remise en conf du NLG (remontage des roues, etc...) 
  
 VSD: 
 Dejacking de l'A/C avec monitoring H,T,P une fois l'avion sur ses roues => On est bon. 
 Retour de l'A/C en P2 puis fermeture pour le week-end. 
  
 25 Septembre: 
 Monitoring du NLG avec H119mm pour 138, P:66b et T:12.4°C => On a reperdu hauteur/pression pendant le week-end. 
 On demande un avis MAP 
 A la demande de la MAP: 
 - On re-jacke l'A/C pour confirmer qu'il y a bien une fuite de N² 
 - On checke H,T,P puis on contrôle la nato au gazobulle => Pas de fuite constatée mais perte de pression avec 16b pour 19,6b. 
 - Ouverture de la nato et dégonflage du NLG sur jacks pour la nuit. 
  
 26 Septembre: 
 SLS refait le servicing suivant AMM du NLG (Servicing N°3) en présence de la MAP => Il manquait encore 0.2l 
 Regonflage du NLG en N² suivant AMM par l'équipe DAS en présence de la MAP. 
 On dejacke l'A/C. 
 On refait un contrôle H,T,P => On est bon.
